How it is working?
**The first stage** is the front end that is used for parsing source code. It checks the code for errors and builds a language-specific Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to work as its input code.

**The second stage** is the optimizer that is used for optimizing the AST that was generated by the frontend.

**The third and final stage** is the back end. This is responsible for generating the final code to be executed by the machine which can depend on the target.
